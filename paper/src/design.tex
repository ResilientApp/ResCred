\section{Design}

We propose the following design for our supply chain security blockchain:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participating parties
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Suppliers
            \item Manufacturers 
            \item Distributors 
            \item Retailers 
            \item Transporters
        \end{itemize} 
    \item Users 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Government 
            \item Audtiors 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Records
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Inventory
            \item Smart Contracts \\
                Every time a transport takes place, three smart contracts are formed between the
                three parties, namely between the senders and receivers, the sender and the
                transporter, as well as the transporter and receiver. 
            \item Movement tracking \\
                The transporter can append transactions to record the movement of goods.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
