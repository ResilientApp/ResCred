\section{Design}

We propose the following design for CredRes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Person undergoes the certification process, creates a DID (Decentralized Identifier) if they donâ€™t have one already, and reports to the issuing body.
    \item Issuing bodies, such as government agencies, training programs, and educational institutions can add credential information to the permissioned blockchain, vouching for the attainment with their own DID.
    \item Web UI allows credential holders to issue a signed message to employers, proving their identity / ownership.
\end{enumerate}
