\section{Design}

We propose the following design for CredRes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Person undergoes the certification process, creates a DID (Decentralized Identifier) if they don’t have one already, and reports to the issuing body.
    \item Issuing bodies, such as government agencies, training programs, and educational institutions can add credential information to the permissioned blockchain, vouching for the attainment with their own DID.
    \item Web UI allows credential holders to issue a signed message to employers, proving their identity / ownership. If a user holds multiple credentials across different institutions, they can merge them into one wallet for ease of management.
    \item Smart contracts can be implemented to confirm whether the credential is valid, expired or revoked and respond with error message/verification status. Employers and third parties initiate verification requests by using smart contracts on the blockchain. This automatically verifies credential’s validity as well as the issuer ID.
\end{enumerate}
