\section{Proposed solution}

We plan on developing a decentralized application utilizing ResilientDB to create a public blockchain to store, verify, and manage credentials. Each certification will be recorded on ResilientDB as a transaction between an issuing body and a credential holder, allowing anyone to see the issuing and modification history of that record. Only authorized institutions will have the ability to issue, expire, or revoke credentials while remaining publicly accessible and verifiable.
