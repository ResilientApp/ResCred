\section{Proposed solution}

We plan on developing a decentralized application utilizing ResilientDB to create an open blockchain
to store and verify credentials. Each certification/credential will be recorded on ResilientDB as a
transaction, allowing anyone to see the issuing and modification history of that record. Only
authorized institutions will have the ability to issue credentials that are immutable while publically
accessible and verifiable.
