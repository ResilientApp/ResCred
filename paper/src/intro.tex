\section{Overview}

We propose a permissioned blockchain-based credential verification system to ensure the validity of credentials and certifications that are being held by individuals and organizations alike. This benefits all parties involved—the issuing body, credential holder, and verifier—to track the lifecycle of certifications in a decentralized, public database that is resilient to forging, allowing more trust to be placed in such credentials.
