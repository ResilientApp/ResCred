\section{Overview}

We propose a permissioned blockchain credential verification system to ensure the validity of
credentials and certifications that are being held by individuals. This helps all parties involved
to issue such certs in a public database which is decentralized and resilient to certain attack
vectors, allowing more trust to be placed in such credentials.
