\section{Problem statement}

Global supply chains are often complex and fragmented~\cite{hbrSupplychain}, involving multiple stakeholders that may not always trust each other. Issues such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delays and inefficiencies due to manual processes, poor coordination, and lack of real-time tracking.
    \item Lack of transparency in product sourcing and movement.
        \item
            Difficulty in tracing the origins of products, which can lead to counterfeit goods, substandard products, or unethical sourcing.
\end{itemize}
These challenges not only impact the efficiency and trustworthiness of supply chains but can also lead to fraud, financial loss, and reputational damage for businesses and consumers alike.
Blockchain technology offers a potential solution by providing a decentralized, immutable ledger where all participants in the supply chain can record and verify transactions in a transparent and secure manner.
