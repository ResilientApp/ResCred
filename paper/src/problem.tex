\section{Problem statement}

With the amount of identity fraud and credential falsification ranging from Fake diplomas to Fake Food Permits, existing credentials relies on a handful of centralized institutions and manual verification processes to ensure the legitimacy of the certifications/credentials that have been issued to those individuals and legal entities (such as businesses). The current process has several challenges: it is time-consuming, prone to human error, and is harder to scale due to bottlenecks like response delay. Worst, it is often the case that the verification is not undertaken at all due to the tediousness. We believe a scalable and tamper-proof database is needed to provide transparent access and verification of credentials by the general public, including employers.
