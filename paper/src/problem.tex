\section{Problem statement}

Existing processes for credential verification relies on a handful of centralized institutions and manual verification processes to ensure the legitimacy of the certifications/credentials that have been issued to those individuals and legal entities (such as businesses). The current process has several challenges: it is time-consuming, prone to human error, and is harder to scale due to bottlenecks like response delay. Worst, it is often the case that the verification is not undertaken at all due to the tediousness. With the amount of identity fraud and credential falsification ranging from forged diplomas to food permits, the development of alternative systems are warranted to eliminate any room for error, inefficiency, and falsification. We believe a scalable and tamper-proof database is needed to provide transparent access and verification of credentials by the general public, including employers.
