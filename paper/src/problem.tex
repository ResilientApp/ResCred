\section{Problem statement}

Current credential verification is reliant on a handful of centralized institutions and manual
verification processes to ensure the legitimacy of the certifications/credentials that have been
issued to those individuals. 
We believe a scalable and tamper-proof database is needed to provide a more public view into the
database of credential for easier verification by outsiders (like employers).
