\section{Objectives}
The main objectives of ResCred are to ensure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure Verification \\
        We aim to be able to verify any transaction record in the database via any replica, using
        asymmetric cryptography to confirm the authenticity of the issuing body;
    \item Efficiency \\
        By removing intermediaries from the issuing and verification process, it improves
        reliability and the timeliness of verifying such credentials, especially when everyone is
        able to make a copy of the blockchain (replicas) for their own process. They are no longer
        reliant on a third party to triage paperwork and obtain records;
    \item Transparency \\
        ResCred aims to provide the public with a non-fungible record of credentials issued and
        revoked, allowing all parties involved to inspect the pipeline and all credentials issued by
        and to everyone; and
    \item Decentralization \\
        This allows an unlimited number of replicas to exist at any point, without a central
        controlling authority, which also helps mitigate any potential bottleneck and/or shutdowns
        that may be caused by having some central figure for issuing and verification.
\end{itemize}
