\section{Objectives}
The main objectives of this project are to ensure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure Verification:
        To be able to verify any transaction record in the database via any replica;
    \item Efficiency: 
        To remove an intermediary from the issuing and verification process;
    \item Transparency: 
        To provide a public non-fundgible record of credentials issued and revoked; and
    \item Decentralization:
        To allow an unlimited number of replicas to exist at any point, without a central
        controlling authority
\end{itemize}
