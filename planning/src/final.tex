\section{Future progress}
We plan on continuing to adapt the plan as we face roadblocks and challenges.
Given that we are using some relatively new tools, we anticipate a multitude of potential bugs with
the frameworks and existing codebases within ResilientDB, especially with Smart Contracts.
Should we discover some signficant problem with our toolset (ex. critical missing feature in Smart
Contracts), we may pivot to implementing a fix towards Smart Contracts and reduce the scope of our
intended project such that it becomes a mere extension of an existing one.
Thus, we aim to revisit our project plans towards the midterm report with a more detailed view on
our progress and future plans.
