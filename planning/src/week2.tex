\subsection{Week 2 (11 November 2024)}
Objective: Implement frontend logic, integrating with Smart Contracts GraphQL service \\
Tasks: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Vikram: Integrate smart contract deployment with GraphQL service, utilizing the developed smart contract from Zhenkai. All Issuing Body rely on the same contract, only passing in different values to the contract constructor depending on the Issuing Bodyâ€™s needs. An Issuing Body can technically intercept and modify the contract being deployed, but at their own risk. Addresses of smart contracts must be stored in the browser's local storage.
    \item Frederico: Implement credential import feature that stores passphrase-protected credentials to storage. To verify whether the credential is valid, use GraphQL to confirm that the credential is stored on the correlated smart contract.
    \item Avni: Integrate Verifier UI with GraphQL service.
    \item Ethan: Test smart contract creation and credential issuance with ResContract CLI.
    \item Zhenkai: Set up GraphQL Smart Contract service and integrate GraphQL account creation request with frontend.
    \item All: Prepare the midterm progress report.
