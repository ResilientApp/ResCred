\section{Overview}
By utilizing ResilientDB, a permissioned blockchain, the Resilient DB Credential Management (ResCred) project aims to overcome inefficiencies and opaqueness in current academic/occupational credential verification procedures by developing a decentralized, transparent, and secure credential management system. Conventional verification relies on a small number of authorities to confirm credentials, which are prone to bottlenecks, human mistake, and identity theft.

Through smart contracts, ResCred seeks to democratize and expedite credential issuance and verification. This will allow entities to manage, issue, and revoke credentials while enabling credential holders and verifiers to safely interact with the data. ResCred improves security and efficiency by using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and cryptographic validation to create a publicly visible, tamper-proof ledger that reduces identity and centralization issues.
