\section{Future Work and advice}

We stronly recommend future students taking ECS189F who wish to continue this project consider the possibility of substituting the underlying EVM implementation, or pivoting to an architecture where more involved smart contract capabilities are not needed for the tech stack to function as a whole.
In fact, any future projects considering planning to utilize the SmartContract CLI should consider
making their project on modifying, updating, and documenting SmartContract.
From our experience interacting and working with the current SmartContract interface, we have found
some significant flaws as mentioned in \autoref{ssec:Roadblocks}.
